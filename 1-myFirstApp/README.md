# 1-myFirstApp

## The folder structure that was created by the command

```text
|-- 1-myFirstApp
    |-- bin
    |-- obj
    |-- 1-myFirstApp.csproj
    |-- Program.cs
```

The bin is where your application will get built to. So if you opened your terminal in that folder and run the exe file it should produce the same output as when we ran it before.

The obj folder is where all the external libraries are stored. For this workshop we don't need to look inside this folder.

The `1-myFirstApp.csproj` file is the C# project file, this is an XML file that contains all the information that the complier requires to build and run your application.

The `Program.cs` is where all of our code is located in this project. As this is only a starting project we only use a single file but as projects grow we will start to use more .cs files. Explanation of what the code is doing and the structure is written as comments in my example.
